Description-

	The game has a MSDOS console game menu that allows the option to play the game, view of the high score list, or quit.  The high score list is sorted by the highest score using a linked list.  The top 10 scores are saved to a file when the game is exited and the file is read when the program is loaded.  When you play the game it switches to MSDOS video mode and has a graphical menu that allows the user to change color schemes using the cursor, view the high scores, or play the game. The game uses the keys "a" and "d" to move the paddle left and right.  A score keeps going until the user fails to hit the ball with the paddle.  At the end of the game the user enters his name and score and then it is saved to the top 10 list if the score is high enough. The user can exit the game by hitting "e" and it will quit the game. 


How to run the pong game-

	1. First you need to have a windows 98 version of MSDOS using a virtual machine or DOSBOX.
	2. Then you will need a way to assemble the code, I used Turbo Assembler to assemble it.
	3. Put all the files from the repository into one folder.
	4. In MSDOS, move to that folder location.
	5. Run the run.bat file and it will run the program if you are using Turbo Assembler.
